===========
A KeePass 2.x file viewer developing to run on Firefox OS.

Firefox OS‚Å“®‚­‚±‚Æ‚ğ–Ú•W‚ÉŠJ”­’†B

Usage
-----
1. Open index.html with Nightly
2. Enter Master Password.
3. Select kdbx file.

Limitation
----------
- Support only Master Password. 
- **Very slow** transforming key. 

Check Key transformation setting in Database Settings if database content will not appear after file selection.
Please tell me if you have any idea speeding up key transformation.
